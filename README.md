# mir-navigation

This repository concerns the development of an autonomous mobile base with the MiR 100 for the *Symbiotic Human-Robot Collaboration in Joint Manufacturing Tasks* project within the scope of *HIM â€“ Human Interfacing & Mimicking in Cyber-Physical Systems.*

The repository holds ROS simulation packages for the MiR robot credited to the [DFKI, the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/dfki-ric/mir_robot), which built the base for our work.

The design and development of the Navigation Goals modules is of our responsibility. For more information, refer to the Wiki page.
